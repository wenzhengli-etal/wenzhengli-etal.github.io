This study examines the efficacy of urban spatial patterns at alleviating the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Germany’s city regions (Großstadtregionen) using multivariate and non-parametric regression methods. Urban spatial patterns are quantified using five landscape metrics that capture the spatial arrangement of urban footprints and greenspaces, along with a polycentricity index that measures the distribution of human activities. The results indicate that certain features of urban fabric, including fragmentation, mixed land use, and regular-shaped urban patches, have the potential to mitigate the UHI effect. Moreover, dispersing multiple smaller greenspaces throughout the urban area demonstrates a greater cooling effect compared to having a single large and more aggregated park. In addition, our analysis reveals that a doubling (100%) of the polycentricity degree corresponds to a significant decrease in both day- and night-time UHI effects, with reductions of 10.4% and 24.6%, respectively. This study confirms that polycentric development yields greater benefits in reducing urban heat for large-sized city regions compared to medium- and small-sized ones; and its effectiveness is mostly pronounced near urban center(s). These findings suggest that polycentric development represents an efficient and feasible strategy for urban thermal planning of large-sized city regions, surpassing other commonly discussed urban configurations, such as compact or dispersed urban development.
