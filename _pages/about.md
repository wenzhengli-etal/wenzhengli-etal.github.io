I am a Visiting Lecturer in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell Unversity(https://aap.cornell.edu/people/wenzheng-li). I earned my Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning from Cornell in August 2024.

As a lecturer, I teach a series of quantitative courses at Cornell CRP that equip undergraduate and graduate students in urban planning with spatial data analysis skills and the ability to integrate emerging technology (e.g., GeoAI, machine learning) with theory to address urban and regional issues. My courses include Intro to GIS (CRP 4080/5080), Urban Data Science (CRP 4680/5680, DESIGN 4680/5680), Mapping and Counter-mapping (CRP 4280/5280, co-taught with Prof. Wenfei Xu), Neighborhood Change and Quantitative Methods (CRP 2100, co-taught with Prof. Wenfei Xu), and Intro to Stats (CRP 1200). 

My research focuses on regional-scale land use planning and governance, with a particular interest in how planning institutions, regulatory environments, and land use policies can effectuate more sustainable and equitable spatial patterns in both developed and developing countries. I am currently studying regional polycentricity, with an emphasis on the impacts of polycentric development on economic development, regional disparities, quality of life, and environmental sustainability (e.g., urban heat island effect, air pollution, and commuting patterns). My ongoing research projects include:  

(1) examining sustainable urban forms in Sub-Saharan African cities; 
(2) analyzing regional cooperation and coordination in Chinese and USA metropolitan regions, 
(3) and assessing the value of environmental amenities (e.g., green space and clean water) in areas facing rapid environmental degradation. 

I extensively combines GIS/remote sensing, econometrics, and urban data analytics in research.

Beyond teaching and research, I advise undergraduate students and serve on the editorial board of Growth and Change.

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Project Assistant at the Tompkins County Department of Social Services, where I contributed to the [Mobility-as-a-Services (Maas) pilot project](https://learn.sharedusemobilitycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Tompkins__SUMC_MOD-On-Ramp-Program-Lessons-Learned-Webinar_June-23-2020.pdf), funded by FTA and Shared-use Mobility Center (SUMC), to develop more affordable and equitable multi-modal mobility options for socially vulnerable communities. I hold a Master's in Regional Planning (MRP) from Cornell, where my research focused on green justice and evaluating non-market environment goods using hedonic model.
