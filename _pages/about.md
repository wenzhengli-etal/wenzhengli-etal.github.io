I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [City and Regional Planning at Cornell Unversity](https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/department-city-and-regional-planning). My dissertation focuses on regional scale land use planning, with a particular interest in how planning institutions, regulatory environments and land use policies can effectuate more sustainable and equitable spatial patterns in both developed and developing countries. 

My past and current research projects also involve the topics of sustainable development goals (SDGs), housing, regional science, and shared-use mobility in the US, European countries, China, and Africa. I extensively utilize quantitative analytical approaches in my research, including urban spatial data analytics, econometrics, GIS, and remote sensing. 

Before join the Ph.D. program, I worked as a Project Assistant at the Tompkins County Department of Social Services, where I engaged in the [Mobility-as-a-Services (Maas) pilot project](https://learn.sharedusemobilitycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Tompkins__SUMC_MOD-On-Ramp-Program-Lessons-Learned-Webinar_June-23-2020.pdf), funded by FTA and Shared-use Mobility Center (SUMC), to develop more affordable and equitable mobility options for socially vulnerable communities. I received my Master's in Regional Planning (MRP) from Cornell, focusing on green justice and evaluating non-valued goods using hedonic model.
