I am a [Visiting Lecturer in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell Unversity](https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/department-city-and-regional-planning). I also earned my Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning at Cornell University in August 2024.

As a lecturer, I teach a series of quantitative courses at Cornell CRP that equip undergraduate and graduate students with skills in spatial data analysis and integrating emerging technology (e.g., GeoAI, machine learning) and theory to address urban and regional issues. My courses include Intro to GIS (CRP 4080/5080), Intro to Urban Data Science (CRP 4680/5680, DESIGN 4680/5680), Mapping and Counter-mapping (CRP 4280/5280, co-taught with Prof. Wenfei Xu), Neighborhood Change and Quantitative Methods (CRP 2100, co-taught with Prof. Wenfei Xu), and Intro to Statistics (CRP 1200). Students in my class come from different disciplines, such as Urban Planning, Urban Studies, Regional Science, Environmental Sustainability, Real Estate, Urban Design, Public Policy, and Global Development.

My research focuses on regional-scale land use planning and governance, with a particular interest in how planning institutions, regulatory environments, and land use policies can effectuate more sustainable and equitable spatial patterns in both developed and developing countries. I am currently studying regional polycentricity, with an emphasis on the impacts of polycentric development on economic development, regional disparities, quality of life, and environmental sustainability (e.g., urban heat island effect, air pollution, and commuting patterns, etc). In addition, my ongoing research projects include examining the sustainable urban forms in Sub-Saharan African cities, regional cooperation and coordination in Chinese and USA metropolitan regions, and assessing the value of environmental amenities (e.g., green space and clean water) in areas experiencing rapid environmental degradation. I extensively combines GIS/remote sensing, econometrics, and urban data analytics in research.

In addition to teaching and research, I serve as an advisor for undergraduate students and as a member of the editorial board for Growth and Change.

Before join the Ph.D. program, I worked as a Project Assistant at the Tompkins County Department of Social Services, where I engaged in the [Mobility-as-a-Services (Maas) pilot project](https://learn.sharedusemobilitycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Tompkins__SUMC_MOD-On-Ramp-Program-Lessons-Learned-Webinar_June-23-2020.pdf), funded by FTA and Shared-use Mobility Center (SUMC), to develop more affordable and equitable multi-modal mobility options for socially vulnerable communities. I received my Master's in Regional Planning (MRP) from Cornell, focusing on green justice and evaluating non-valued goods using hedonic model.
