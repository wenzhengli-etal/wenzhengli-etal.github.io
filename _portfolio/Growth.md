This paper examines the spatial-temporal evolution of urban spatial structure across 269 Chinese prefectural cities from 2002 to 2017. While previous studies have found that Chinese cities are becoming more polycentric, our analysis reveals that a consistent trend toward polycentricity is only observed among the 25 largest cities. The evolutionary pathways of small- and mediumsized cities are complex and diverse, with some becoming more polycentric while the majority presenting a monocentric trend. When seeking explanations for this divergent growth pattern, our findings highlight the pivotal role played by population growth and governmental policies in shaping polycentricity in large cities. For small and medium-sized cities, policy intervention tends to outweigh market dynamics in driving polycentricity, while population growth often associates with a more monocentric spatial configuration, characterized by fast growth of urban main center. Finally, we propose a stylized framework to better capture the diversity and complexity of the evolutionary patterns of urban spatial structure in Chinese prefectural cities.
